About IPDevice
--------------
This program was originally written by Samuel Abels <spam debain org>.
It is distributed under the terms of the GPL which you should have
received along with this package. If you didn't, get it here:
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html

IPDevice provides modules for holding informations regarding IP devices;
currently, Cisco and Juniper routers are supported.

If you are lucky, I have been sedulous enough to create a project page
on my homepage. Have a look at http://www.debain.org.


Development
-----------
Development is primarily done in an environment where CVS access to
public internet severs does exist. Thus, the code in CVS may be
outdated. If you are interested in development, contact one of the
authors (see AUTHORS).
